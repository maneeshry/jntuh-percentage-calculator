# mini-project
With the increasing adoption of business models and technologies related to software development, the scrum methodology is used in order to achieve goals efficiently. The object-oriented programming languages like java-8 are used for developing software projects in a short period of time. The current advanced tools which are used for developing the projects are maven, for continuous integration of the project, hibernate for mapping object-oriented domain model to relational database model which are also platform-independent., PostgreSQL an open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance, selenium a test automation tool for testing web applications, Docker which is popular emerging technology combines several areas from systems research such as operating systems, virtualization, cross platform portability, modular re-usable elements Virtualization is used for the creation of a virtual resource such as server, desktop, operating system, file, storage or network, Git, a free, open source distributed version control system tool designed to handle projects with speed and efficiency. With the help of these tools, a dynamic web application will be developed where the project addresses the common problem faced by the students while calculating their percentage for a particular semester or for the overall academics (JNTUH norms). The performance of the student is depicted in the form of a bar graph.
