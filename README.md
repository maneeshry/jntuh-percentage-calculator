# mini-project
This project addresses the common problem faced by the students while calculating their percentage for a particular semester or for the overall academics (JNTUH norms). To solve this problem a web application has been created where the user has to enter the grades he obtained for the respective subjects and after submitting the form the user gets his calculated percentage prompted.
